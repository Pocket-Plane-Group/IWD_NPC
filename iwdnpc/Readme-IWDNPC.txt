1. Introduction
----------------

The Icewind Dale NPCs mod introduces a cast of five new characters to the
great frozen wastes of the Forgotten Realms, with all the depth you would
expect from PPG companions. The mod will transform the Icewind Dale
experience into the story of a single, player-defined protagonist, and
his or her fully-interactive allies. 

The mod includes a fighter, ranger, multi-classed thief, paladin, and bard. 
A fighter can be dual-classed into a cleric or a druid, starting with
level 2. Alternate classes are also available.

Each character comes with a new, original portrait, full voicing,
interactions with the PC and each other, and quest commentary
and interjections. Romance is also in the bitterly cold air...

The last version is available at http://www.pocketplane.net/iwdnpc


This version of Icewind Dale NPC mod is available for IWD-in-BG2 conversion,
if you wish to play Icewind Dale in Baldur's gate 2 engine. The conversion
itself is available at http://www.gibberlings3.net/


This version of Icewind Dale NPC mod is available for IWD:EE(Icewind Dale:
Enhanced Edition), as well.


----------------
2. Installation
----------------

HEART OF WINTER EXPANSION IS REQUIRED!

It is highly recommended to install Tales of the Luremaster(a free expansion).
If you install Tales of the Luremaster, you do not have to patch your game.

To save you time and effort, it is recommended to backup dialog.tlk,
chitin.key, icewind.ini, IDMain.exe and override directory before installing
any mods. This way, you can restore your "clean install" in seconds by
deleting weidu.log, dialog.tlk, chitin.key, icewind.ini, IDMain.exe, override
directory and mod folders, and restoring backups. IWD:EE users
are recommended to backup their language directory.

Some (older) mods may overwrite IWD NPC. As such, it is recommended
to install IWD NPC after them.

Make sure that Icewind Dale or ANY game-related utilities are not running.

To install the mod, run IWDNPC.exe. 

If you are playing IWD:EE or IWD-in-BG2 conversion, simply choose
your IWD-in-BG2 directory(the one with chitin.key file),
install the mod, and start your game.

Your new companions will wait for you in the Easthaven tavern.

They will also be available in the Kuldahar tavern and
the Lonelywood tavern later in the game.

For the original Icewind Dale:

To start playing, create your protagonist in the first slot, and import your
companions(O#Holvir, O#Korin, O#Nella, O#Severn and O#Teri) alongside. Make
sure to choose correct soundsets(O#Holvir, O#Korin, O#Nella, O#Severn and
O#Teri) for them.

IMPORTANT! IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO STOP AND WAIT FOR A FEW SECONDS FROM
TIME TO TIME, ESPECIALLY AFTER ENTERING A NEW AREA, TO ENSURE THAT PC-NPC AND
NPC-NPC BANTERS TRIGGER WHEN THEY SHOULD.
(classic IWD only, not IWD-in-BG2 or IWD:EE).

These limitations are not present in IWD-in-BG2 conversion and IWD:EE.

To reinstall or uninstall the mod, run Setup-IWDNPC.exe in your game 
directory.

During the installation, you may choose alternate classes for some of the
characters. To decline, choose "N"("No"). To return to their default classes,
run Setup-IWDNPC.exe in your game directory and choose "U"("Uninstall").

------------------------------------------------------
3. IMPORTANT: STOP OFTEN AND KEEP YOUR PARTY TOGETHER
------------------------------------------------------

For banters: Party members have to be in each other's visual range(detected
by hearing or sight). 

Original Icewind Dale only:

Banters trigger ONLY when the party stops. So stop, and stop often.

IF YOUR GAME CRASHED DURING A DIALOGUE, OR A PARTY MEMBER STUTTERS, RELOAD,
SELECT EACH OF YOUR PARTY MEMBERS AND PRESS K KEY.
(classic IWD only, not IWD-in-BG2 or IWD:EE).

For interjections: A party member has to be in the visual range of the NPC
in question(detected by hearing or sight).

These limitations are not present in IWD-in-BG2 or IWD:EE conversion.
To trigger an interjection, your party member just has to be in the same area.

Naturally, all party members, including the protagonist, have to be alive
and not stunned/held/silenced/otherwise rendered unable to talk.

------------------------------
4. Frequently Asked Questions
------------------------------

Q: What is this mod about?

A: It adds five new original joinable companions to the game of Icewind Dale.
You will be able to create your protagonist in the first slot, and
import them alongside.


Q: What does this mod include?

A: In general, PC-NPC and NPC-NPC interaction. Banters between the companions,
banters with the protagonist, interjections, quest and scenery reactions,
player-initiated dialogue. Certain banters (plot-critical and not)
involve all party members.


Q: Are there friendships? Romances?

A: There are friendships, both between the NPCs and with the protagonist.
Some of these bonds may become something greater. Romances are available
to human, elven and half-elven protagonists.

Male protagonists can romance Teri or Nella. Holvir and Korin are 
romanceable by female protagonists.


Q: What about player-initiated dialogue?

A: Yes, you will be able to initiate dialogue with your companions.
To do this, your protagonist will have to approach the selected NPC
in the game and click on him/her.

(Note that you can do it with another party member instead of your PC
in IWD, but it is NOT supported or recommended.)

Version 4 adds twelve new lovetalks for each romanceable character, two
new ones every chapter, from Chapter 1 to Chapter 6.


Q: Will it work with IWD or IWD: Heart of Winter? What about IWD: Trials
of the Luremaster, an additional free expansion for IWD: HoW?

A: Heart of Winter is required. The free Trials of the Luremaster
expansion is highly recommended. If you download and install it,
you do not have to patch your game.


Q: How does it work? What should I do to get banters and interactions? 

A: Just play the game: enter new areas, slay monsters, complete quests
and find items.  Due to the engine limitations, you will not get
dialogues at rest/at waking/every hour, the way it was done in BG2,
so resting excessively will not affect the game.

As for the interjections, your party members have to be alive
and in the visual range. In general, keeping your companions alive
and close together is recommended.

AND STOP OFTEN, ESPECIALLY AFTER ENTERING A NEW AREA. 
(classic IWD only, not IWD:EE or IWD-in-BG2).

These limitations are not present in IWD-in-BG2 or IWD:EE conversion.
To trigger an interjection, your party member just has to be in the same area.


Q: Any special recommendations?

A: To see the banter with Player1, your protagonist will have to remain in
the first slot.  Also, as you issue movement commands to the party, their
override scripts are temporarily suspended, so you will have to stop to hear
banter. You will not miss dialogues, but it is STRONGLY recommended to stop
for a few seconds from time to time, especially after entering a new area.

These limitations are not present in IWD-in-BG2 or IWD:EE conversion.


Q: Is the mod compatible with other Icewind Dale mods?

A: Yes, the mod installs using Weidu, it takes extra care not to interfere
too much, and it should be compatible with all other mods for Icewind Dale. 

However, since some mods overwrite things, install older mods BEFORE IWD NPC,
for safety reasons, unless the mod's readme says otherwise. IWD NPC also uses
some code from IWD Tweak Pack, and has been extensively tested with it. 

IWD Tweak Pack: http://gibberlings3.net/daletweak


Q: All right, I have a copy of IWD, HoW and ToTL, installed and working.
What will I have to do?

A: You will have to install the mod, start a new game and choose your
protagonist for the first slot.  Then import the rest of the companions
and start playing. 

If you are playing an IWD-in-BG2 or IWD:EE version of the game,
you'll find your companions in the Easthaven tavern.


Q: Does the mod forces a pre-defined background/biography on my protagonist?

A: No, it doesn't.  You will be able to roleplay your protagonist however
you like.


Q: Can I use two or more custom characters?

A: Yes, you can. As long as your protagonist is in the first slot, IWD NPCs
will banter with him and between themselves. 

However, you will get significantly fewer banters and interjections this way:
taking four companions instead of five will cut the amount of content by
about 1/3, and taking only three - by 1/2.


Q: I am not happy with some of the classes and stats, can I use Dale Keeper
or another program to change them?

A: Yes, you can. However, caution is recommended, so that the script
name/override script/dialogue file for the character remains unchanged. 

The mod itself also gives you the opportunity to choose these classes:

Original Icewind Dale:

Holvir, paladin
Korin,  ranger, alternate class: multiclass cleric/ranger
Nella,  fighter, possible dual-class - cleric, druid, alternate class: 
	multiclass fighter/cleric, multiclass fighter/druid
Severn, bard, alternate class: mage, multiclass fighter/mage
Teri,   multiclass fighter/thief, alternate class: thief, multiclass
	mage/thief, multiclass fighter/mage/thief

Icewind Dale in Baldur's Gate 2 engine:

Holvir, paladin
	alternate class: cavalier, inquisitor, undead hunter
Korin,  ranger
	alternate class: archer, beast master, stalker,
	multiclass cleric/ranger
Nella,  fighter, possible dual-class - cleric, druid
	alternate class: berserker, kensai, wizard slayer, monk,
	multiclass fighter/cleric, multiclass fighter/druid
Severn, bard
	alternate class: blade, jester, skald, mage, sorcerer, wild mage,
	multiclass fighter/mage
Teri,   multiclass fighter/thief
	alternate class: thief, assassin, bounty hunter, swashbuckler,
	multiclass mage/thief, multiclass fighter/mage/thief

Note that these options are here for your convenience only. In terms of
roleplaying, Severn's story still implies that he is a bard, and the same is
true for other characters.

Level 1 NPCs mod from Gibberlings3.net is recommended to enhance
your experience and select more alternate classes for your party members.


Q: Can I choose alternate colors or portraits for my party members?

A: Yes, you shall be able to customize them in the game.


Q: Can I choose alternate soundsets for my party members?

A: Yes, you shall be able to customize them in the game. You will also have
to delete all .wav files which start with "o#" from the override directory.
Caution is recommended.


Q: I often hear select sounds when the banter begins. Can it be avoided?

A: Unfortunately, the engine prevents that. Just like the "stop often" rule,
it is one of the hardcoded limitations in classic IWD(not in IWD-in-BG2
or IWD:EE, though).


Q: The game crashed when we talked to character X! A party member stutters!

A: It happened because one of your characters died and "lost" his dialogue
file. Reload, select him and press K key. To be safe, select all your party
members and press K key on each of them in turn.
(classic IWD only, not IWD-in-BG2 or IWD:EE).


Q: I played BG2, but not IWD. What should I expect?

A: IWD does not have sorcerers, monks and barbarians, and spell animations
and incantations differ. Other than that, you won't notice the difference.

Naturally, if you're playing IWD-in-BG2 or IWD:EE conversion, you are going
to have all the advantages of Baldur's Gate 2 engine.


Q: I played Icewind Dale 2, but not Icewind Dale. Will IWD be different?

A: Yes. It is an entirely different story, and it is a very interesting game. 


Q: I have a question about the game itself.

A: Download and read Dan Simpson's walthrough. 


Q: I like the idea! Is there anything like this for other games?

A: Yes, BG1 NPC Project and IWD2 NPC Project.
BG1 NPC Project:  http://gibberlings3.net/bg1npc
IWD2 NPC Project: http://gibberlings3.net/iwd2npc


Q: Does this work for IWD:EE?

A: Yes, it does.
